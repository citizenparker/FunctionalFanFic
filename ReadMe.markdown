# Functional Fan Fic #

Functional Fan Fic is a pretty silly demo app that I made to accompany an introductory talk I did in 2010 on F# & the Bistro framework.

Key features you'll see in this project:

* Defining a homepage with some dynamic data
* Creating a controller that responds to every GET request (in addition to whatever else is set up to handle them too)
* Using both primitives and records to take in form input (look through the history to see an example of the former)
